+-Please record all changes made so we know what has been done and with what conventions. (And how about a name?)



Added initial preset structure for Amino Acids - Ian

Added basic 3D rendering using Java3D- INSTALL THE CORRECT FILE FOR YOUR OS FROM HERE:
 http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javasebusiness/downloads/java-archive-downloads-java-client-419417.html#java3d-1.5.1-oth-JPR -Tyler

Linked up to 3D library and familiarized myself with the code structure for Renderer... seems cool. - Ian

Revamped the 3D rendering system- system renders spheres of any color with any position and any radius. The system also alows the "camera" to be changed:
you can zoom in, zoom out, and "pan" left, right, up and down. -Tyler

More changes to the rendering system- from the driver you can now add atoms to be rendered. 
Each atom has a different color and the Van Der Waals radii are used -Tyler

IMPORTANT- Changed the way dropbox sharing works so we can all use our native libraries- now we should just link this source folder
 to a project stored in a different location -Tyler

Added (Buggy) feature that allows the "camera" to be rotated (Note, currently the rotation rotates the camera. Perhaps a better
method would be to rotate the entire universe?)-Tyler

Changed rotation to rotate universe- now panning and zooming works even when at odd angles -Tyler

Started a covalent bond, and started a vector class. More details to follow. -Avi, Tyler 2/6/14, 4:21 pm. 
Finished the covalent bond class. Left vector class to Tyler to do what he needs with it. -Avi, 2/7/14. 9:41 am.

Started mouse-dragging for rotation (not entirely complete) - Ian and Tyler 2/7/12 9:57:12AM

Added Variables for viewing distance - Ian, 2/7/14 6:29PM

Added rotation around the camera using OrbitBehavior, removed old rotation implementation - Ian, 2/7/14 6:47PM

Added moving forward/backward with mouse scrolling - Ian, 2/7/14 7:09PM

Started a Matrix Class. Did not finish. -Avi 2/14/14 9:56
Finished the Matrix class. -In class 2/20/14 9:52
Added rotation matrices. -Avi 2/24/14

Found this really great website with atom coordinates for Amino Acids! -Avi
http://chemistry.gsu.edu/Glactone/PDB/Amino_Acids/aa.html

Added file writing (teehee) and toStrings for atom and point
